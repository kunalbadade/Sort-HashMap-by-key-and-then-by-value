# Sort-HashMap-by-key-and-then-by-value
Given array of integers needs to be sorted by frequency of occurrences and by value.

For e.g. array [5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4] should be sorted in such a way that results are [1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]

Explanation:
In given array numbers 1,3,4,5 appears once while 2 occurs twice. Thus, numers 1,3,4,5 should be printed first in ascending order and then 2 should be printed as it has appeared twice.
